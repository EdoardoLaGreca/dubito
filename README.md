[Dubito](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubito) (translatable in English as "I doubt") is an Italian card game based on bluff.

## Rules

This card game has many variants, this repository references the Wikipedia version and adds rules whenever something is not specified.

The game requires at least 3 players and makes use of a [standard 52-card deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) (or a 40-card deck, but this is not the case).

### Preparation

The cards are divided among the players in equal parts. The remaining cards, if any, are discarded and cannot be used.

Since this is a computer adaptation of the game, the turns are chosen randomly.

### How to play

There are 5 rules:

- Every player can place from 1 to 4 cards on the table.
- The card(s) placed by one player should be one rank above the card(s) placed by the previous player, unless the player bluffs. 
- Every card placed on the table is placed with its front facing down, so that nobody else actually knows what card it is.
- In any moment, any player can doubt of the card(s) placed by the last player.
- The winner is the first player to end their pack of cards.

The first player begins by placing card(s) at their choosing on the table from their pack. The same is done by the following players. If any player doubts of the card(s) placed by the last player, those card(s) get uncovered and either one of these two things happens:

- The placed cards are correct. In this case the player who doubted gets to take all the cards placed on the table and the last player plays one more time.
- The player bluffed. In this case the player who bluffed gets to take all the cards placed on the table and the turn jumps to the player who doubted.
